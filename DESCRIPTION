Description: A package that uses a C++ function to find and plot the convex hull of a set of   points. The convex hull is a set of points such that, when connected with straight lines, every other point in the set is contained within the convex hull. The method used in the jarvis march gift wrapping algorithm. Limited to the two dimensional case.
